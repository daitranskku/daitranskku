## **Reserach Interest**  
I'm a big fan of deep learning-based computer vision and data analysis. The more data there is, the better.  

## **Experiences**  
- [**Smart Construction IT Lab. - Postdoc Researcher - (March 2023 - Present)**](https://sites.google.com/view/skkuscit)  

- [**SmartInside AI Co., Ltd - Team Lead - (February 2021 - Present)**](https://smartinside.ai/)  
Implement and optimize deep learning-based object detection algorithms for
detecting objects in construction sites using CCTV data. Develop modules for
extracting object features and ensemble models for extracting information from
specific case studies.
- [**Smart Construction IT Lab. - Research Assistant - (September 2018 - Feb. 2023)**](https://sites.google.com/view/skkuscit)  
Using object detection based on deep learning and CCTV data for safety
management research in construction. Utilizing CCTV, UAV images, and
weather data to estimate forest-fire damaged areas. Utilize deep learning
models for ultrasonic wave propagation imaging-based damage detection in
structures.
