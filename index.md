## **About Me**  
I'm a Ph.D. student in [Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Korea.]([skku.edu](https://www.skku.edu/skku/index.do))   
[Email](daitran@skku.edu) - [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dai-quoc-tran-092579116/)  
## **Reserach Interest**  
I'm a big fan of deep learning-based computer vision and data analysis. The more data there is, the better.  
## **Experiences**  
- [**SmartInside AI Co., Ltd - Team Lead - (February 2021 - Present)**](https://smartinside.ai/)  
Implement and optimize deep learning-based object detection algorithms for
detecting objects in construction sites using CCTV data. Develop modules for
extracting object features and ensemble models for extracting information from
specific case studies.
- [**Smart Construction IT Lab. - Research Assistant - (September 2018 - Present)**](https://sites.google.com/view/skkuscit)  
Using object detection based on deep learning and CCTV data for safety
management research in construction. Utilizing CCTV, UAV images, and
weather data to estimate forest-fire damaged areas. Utilize deep learning
models for ultrasonic wave propagation imaging-based damage detection in
structures.
