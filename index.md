## **Research Interest**
Working to improve safety in construction sites using deep learning-based computer vision.
I'm a big fan of deep learning-based computer vision and data analysis. The more data there is, the better.  
I'm also interested in the application of deep learning in the field of non-destructive testing and evaluation (NDT/NDE) and structural health monitoring (SHM).    
## **Experiences**

Develop an end-to-end deep learning-based computer vision system using multiple cameras to monitor construction site safety and progress.
- [**AI Team Lead, SmartInside AI Co., Ltd, Suwon, Korea - (February 2021 - Present)**](https://smartinside.ai/)  
Implement and optimize deep learning-based object detection algorithms for detecting objects in construction sites using CCTV data. Develop modules for
extracting object features and ensemble models for extracting information from specific case studies.

- [**Research Assistant, Smart Construction IT Lab., Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, Korea - (September 2018 - Feb. 2023)**](https://sites.google.com/view/skkuscit)  
Using object detection based on deep learning and CCTV data for safety management research in construction. Utilizing CCTV, UAV images, and
weather data to estimate forest-fire damaged areas. Utilize deep learning models for ultrasonic wave propagation imaging-based damage detection in
structures.
